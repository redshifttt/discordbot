# Hercules Discord Bot

The one bot to rule them all.

Hercules is an all-purpose bot with features that a lot of the usual bots have
and then some. It uses
[tinydb](https://tinydb.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) as the database,
[discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for interacting with
the Discord API, and [nix](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/) to manage
runtime dependencies and sandboxing.

Add the bot to your server then run `./help` for more information.
